<p class="content">
    Many adolescents experience positive mental health, but an estimated 49.5 percent of adolescents has had a
     mental health disorder at some point in their lives The good news is that promoting positive mental health
     can prevent some problems. For young people who do have mental health disorders, early intervention and
     treatment can help lessen the impact on their lives.</p>
     <p class="content">
        It is a normal part of development for teens to experience a wide range of emotions. It is typical, for instance, for teens to feel 
anxious about school or friendships, or to experience a period of depression following the death of a close friend or family member.
 However, mental health disorders are characterized by persistent symptoms that affect how a young person feels, thinks, and acts. 
Mental health disorders also can interfere with regular activities and daily functioning, such as relationships, schoolwork, sleeping,
 and eating.
